        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Olivia Overturf is a multimedia artist and photographer based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin whose work examines the topics of mental health, memory, and self-worth through the use of digital photograph manipulation, installation, and immersive environments. She earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art and Design with a focus in Digital Studio Practice and a Photography cross discipline.</p>

        <p>Her artist practice consists of self-healing and identity questions as her work is heavily based on past traumatic events and how theyâ€™ve affected her daily life. The surreal and hyperreal nature of her work creates an elusive effect, quite like the memories that have inspired her work. Along with this, she also focuses on viewer immersion to create an emotional response of destruction and/or serenity in the visuals to connect herself with the viewer. By making the viewer physically aware of their body and the movements and emotions it feels while viewing her work, it forces them to stop and enjoy a tranquil moment in the chaos of daily life. </p>
